## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [PlatformIO IDE extension](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide).

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Assemble Hardware**: Connect all the components as specified in the [Pinout Connections](#-pinout-connections) table.
3. **Open in PlatformIO**: Open the cloned repository folder in VS Code. PlatformIO should automatically recognize it as a project.
4. **Build and Upload**:
   - Connect the ESP32-S3 to your computer.
   - Use the PlatformIO controls to build and upload the project:
     ```bash
     pio run -t upload
     ```
   - To monitor the serial output for debugging:
     ```bash
     pio device monitor
     ```

## üìñ Major Functions

The firmware is organized into a simple, menu-driven system accessible via the hardware buttons and a web interface.

- **Read Card**:
  - Detects and identifies a nearby NFC card.
  - Reads the card's data (UID, type, and content).
  - Saves a binary dump of the card to the SD card, named after the card's UID (e.g., `04A1B2C3.nfc`).
  - Displays a summary of the card's properties.

- **Write Card**:
  - Lists all saved `.nfc` files from the SD card.
  - Allows you to select a file to write to a blank or rewritable card.
  - *Note: Currently supports writing to Mifare Classic cards.*

- **Emulate Card**:
  - Lists saved `.nfc` files.
  - Emulates the selected card, allowing it to be read by an external NFC reader.

- **Brute Force**:
  - Targets a Mifare Classic card.
  - Iterates through a list of common, default, and known weak keys to try and authenticate with each sector.
  - Reports any found keys and saves them to a log file on the SD card.

- **Card Manager**:
  - Lists all saved card files on the SD card.
  - Allows you to select and delete files to manage storage.

- **Settings**:
  - **Brightness**: Adjust the OLED screen brightness.
  - **Debug**: Toggle debug mode (future feature).
  - **Format SD**: Deletes all saved card files from the `/cards/` directory.
  - **About**: Displays project information.

- **Web Interface**:
  - When the device boots, it starts a Wi-Fi Access Point with the SSID `nfcGOD` and password `money`.
  - Connect to this network and navigate to `http://192.168.4.1` in your browser.
  - The web UI allows you to:
    - View the current device mode.
    - Trigger a card read and see the UID and data dump.
    - Change the device's mode of operation.

## üìù Project To-Dos

This project is under active development. Here are some of the planned features and improvements:
- [ ] **Enhanced Card Support**: Add full support for ISO14443-4A cards and other standards.
- [ ] **Advanced Emulation**: Implement more sophisticated emulation modes, including UID change for compatible cards.
- [ ] **GUI Overhaul**: Improve the user interface with better graphics and more detailed information displays.
- [ ] **Key Management**: Add a feature to manage and use custom keys for Mifare Classic authentication.
- [x] **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Integration**: Add remote control or data transfer capabilities over Wi-Fi or BLE. (Basic implementation complete)
- [ ] **PCAP Logging**: Save raw NFC traffic to a `.pcap` file for analysis in tools like Wireshark.
- [ ] **Save/Load Brute-Force State**: Allow pausing and resuming long-running brute-force attacks.

## üìö Libraries Used

This project relies on the following excellent libraries:
- **Adafruit PN532**: For interfacing with the NFC module.
- **Adafruit GFX & SSD1306**: For rendering graphics and text on the OLED display.
- **ESPAsyncWebServer & AsyncTCP**: For the web interface.
- **SPI, Wire, SD**: Core Arduino libraries for communication protocols.
