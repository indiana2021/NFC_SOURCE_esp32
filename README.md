### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Assemble Hardware**: Connect all the components as specified in the [Pinout Connections](#-pinout-connections) table.
3. **Open in PlatformIO**: Open the cloned repository folder in VS Code. PlatformIO should automatically recognize it as a project.

     pio device monitor
     ```

## üìñ Major Functions

The firmware is organized into a simple, menu-driven system.

- **Read Card**:
  - Detects and identifies a nearby NFC card.
  - Reads the card's data (UID, type, and content).
  - Saves a binary dump of the card to the SD card, named after the card's UID (e.g., `04A1B2C3.nfc`).
  - Displays a summary of the card's properties.

- **Write Card**:
  - Lists all saved `.nfc` files from the SD card.
  - Allows you to select a file to write to a blank or rewritable card.
  - *Note: Currently supports writing to Mifare Classic cards.*

- **Emulate Card**:
  - Lists saved `.nfc` files.
  - Emulates the selected card, allowing it to be read by an external NFC reader.

- **Brute Force**:
  - Targets a Mifare Classic card.
  - Iterates through a list of common, default, and known weak keys to try and authenticate with each sector.
  - Reports any found keys and saves them to a log file on the SD card.

- **Card Manager**:
  - Lists all saved card files on the SD card.
  - Allows you to select and delete files to manage storage.

- **Settings**:
  - **Brightness**: Adjust the OLED screen brightness.
  - **Debug**: Toggle debug mode (future feature).
  - **Format SD**: Deletes all saved card files from the `/cards/` directory.
  - **About**: Displays project information.

## üìù Project To-Dos

This project is under active development. Here are some of the planned features and improvements:
